This repository demonstrated how a clustering algorithm can be altered and implemented as per the resources available. Here, by resources we refer to machines. In cases where we are running hadoop on a stand alone mode or say in a single machine, and you have huge gigs of data to process, you can implement the clustering algorithm in such a way that the machine processes certain lines of data, zips it and stores it as a separate file, and ultimately combines all the data points to deliver the final output.

The clusterApp.java found in this repository implements a similar logic.
